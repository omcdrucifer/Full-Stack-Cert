## Portfolio Project 2: Portfolio Website

### Parameters
As the title suggests, the second project is to build a portfolio website. The main page should include a list of
projects and some information about me. The second page is for contact information. The project is constrained to two
pages maximum. The site should be built using HTML, CSS, and at least one interactive JS element.

### POC
At this point I am just getting started and I have to use a wire frame to plan out the site before I start building
anything. I have a basic idea of what I want it to look like but I need to get it on paper so to speak.

### Conclusion
