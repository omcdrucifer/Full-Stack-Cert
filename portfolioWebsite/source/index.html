                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a geek who loves technology. My formal background is in graphic design. You could
                say I'm a late bloomer. I started getting into tech as a hobby in mid 2024. I've been learning to
                program and work with hardware to an extent. I'm not building any CPUs or anything. But I can fix your
                Xbox, build a computer, or design a website.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have been learning computer science and also I have started doing board level repairs on home
                electronics. Currently I am working on game consoles. I've done repairs on my own Xbox Series X and am
                fixing an original Xbox for a coworker currently. Ages ago while in college I did repairs on my own
                Xbox360 out of necessity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've always been a tinkerer, but never considered pushing it to a career until recently. My goal is
                to transition to some kind of tech role, perhaps programming. I currently am familiar with Python, JS,
                HTML &amp; CSS, bash, and a dash of C++. I work primarily on Linux, but am what I like to refer to as OS
                agnostic. I can work with all three of the major desktop environments.</p>

                    <h3>Financial Calculator</h3>
                    <p>Small terminal app that I built with Python that can make financial calculations. Specifically it
                    can calculate monthly loan payments and total interest paid over the life of the loan. It can also
                    calculate dividend payments for interest bearing deposit accounts like CDs and Money Markets. Also
                    made a GUI wrapper for it with the Tkinter library.</p>

                    <h3>Terminal RPG Game</h3>
                    <p>This one is still in progress but has a significant amount of logic already in place. It is an
                    RPG game that is played in a terminal and mimics 1990's style text based choose your own adventure
                    games. Currently has logic in place for player characters, npcs, enemies and bosses. It also has
                    party management logic, combat logic, control flow logic, and a logic tree to control the story.
                    Currently written in Python but may consider rewriting later down the road to make it playable on
                    the web.</p>

                    <p>This website is itself a portfolio project. Mostly built with CSS and HTML, with a splash of
                    JavaScript.</p>

                    <h3>Board level repair of an Original Xbox</h3>
                    <p>A coworker brought their Xbox to me and asked me if I could fix it. That one day it just wouldn't
                    boot. I took it home and accepted the challenge. I've determined from the diagnostic lights that it
                    is an overheat issue. But the machine hasn't started in a long time. I opened it, cleaned a little
                    corrosion I found, and dusted it. With some help from Reddit I have determined the chip at U6F1 is
                    likely bad/dead and needs to be replaced as that chip controls overheat signals and was near the
                    previously mentioned corrosion.</p>
