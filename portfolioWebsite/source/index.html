                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a geek who loves technology. My formal background is in graphic design. You could
                say I'm a late bloomer. I started getting into tech as a hobby in mid 2024. I've been learning to
                program and work with hardware to an extent. I'm not building any CPUs or anything. But I can fix your
                Xbox, build a computer, or design a website.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have been learning computer science and also I have started doing board level repairs on home
                electronics. Currently I am working on game consoles. I've done repairs on my own Xbox Series X and am
                fixing an original Xbox for a coworker currently. Ages ago while in college I did repairs on my own
                Xbox360 out of necessity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've always been a tinkerer, but never considered pushing it to a career until recently. My goal is
                to transition to some kind of tech role, perhaps programming. I currently am familiar with Python, JS,
                HTML &amp; CSS, bash, and a dash of C++. I work primarily on Linux, but am what I like to refer to as OS
                agnostic. I can work with all three of the major desktop environments.</p>

                        <h3>Financial Calculator</h3>
                        <p>Small terminal app that I built with Python that can make financial calculations. Specifically it
                        can calculate monthly loan payments and total interest paid over the life of the loan. It can also
                        calculate dividend payments for interest bearing deposit accounts like CDs and Money Markets. Also
                        made a GUI wrapper for it with the Tkinter library.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button onclick="toggleDetails('project1')">Show Details</button>
                    <div id="project1" class="details">
                        <p>The project uses class objects in Python and uses class inheritance via a parent/child class
                        relationship. The parent class acts as a sort of traffic director and controls the flow of the rest
                        of the program based on user inputs. It prompts the user to pick a loan or savings project, then
                        summons the next appropriate class object based on the user's choice. It asks for the user to input
                        the interest rate when calculating loans and uses JSON objects to store tiered dividend rates for
                        money market accounts where the dividend rate is determined by the average daily balance of the
                        account.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The terminal version of the app uses some simple ASCII art to make the program more visually
                        appealing. The GUI wrapper was made with the customtkinter library, which is a modified version of
                        the tkinter library and offers a more modern look and feel.</p>

                        <h3>Terminal RPG Game</h3>
                        <p>This one is still in progress but has a significant amount of logic already in place. It is an
                        RPG game that is played in a terminal and mimics 1990's style text based choose your own adventure
                        games. Currently has logic in place for player characters, npcs, enemies and bosses. It also has
                        party management logic, combat logic, control flow logic, and a logic tree to control the story.
                        Currently written in Python but may consider rewriting later down the road to make it playable on
                        the web.</p>

                    <div id="project2" class="details">
                        <p>This one is a self driven project and I assigned it to myself to give myself a more significant
                        challenge than just writing something that can be done with a couple hundred lines of code, as was
                        often the case with portfolio projects I was assigned. So I set out to design a game because that is
                        definitely a project that requires many many lines of code, even in a simplified form like what I am
                        currently working on.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In addition to the features I mentioned above, there is menu management (albeit plain text to fit
                        the theme) and a save management system. The save files are JSON objects that capture the important
                        details like player character attributes, location within the game, etc. At this point I want to get
                        the story written before I work on any more features. Up to this point I have been testing the story
                        tree with fragmented generic story elements just to make sure the logic works.</p>

                        JavaScript.</p>

                        Codecademy. While I do have some prior experience with HTML &amp; CSS from college design courses, I
                        took the easy route for a long time and used WYSIWYG software like Adobe Muse. So I need to not only
                        knock the dust off but catch up on a decade of changes between them both. That was the early days of
                        HTML5.</p>

                        <p>A coworker brought their Xbox to me and asked me if I could fix it. That one day it just wouldn't
                        boot. I took it home and accepted the challenge. I've determined from the diagnostic lights that it
                        is an overheat issue. But the machine hasn't started in a long time. I opened it, cleaned a little
                        corrosion I found, and dusted it. With some help from Reddit I have determined the chip at U6F1 is
                        likely bad/dead and needs to be replaced as that chip controls overheat signals and was near the
                        previously mentioned corrosion.</p>

                        <p>I have received the microchip I was waiting for. So I am going to replace the offending heat
                        sensor chip and see if that resolves the issue. If it doesn't my plan is to troubleshoot the PSU
                        next.</p>
