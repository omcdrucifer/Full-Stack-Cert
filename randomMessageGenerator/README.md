## Portfolio Project 1: Random Message Generator

### Parameters

As previously mentioned, the basic concept is a random message generator. The concept is obviously very broad, so we
will put a pin in that for now. The messages are supposed to be fragmented in at least three parts, this seems to suggest
an almost Mad Libs type of approach. Being that the assignment is meant to demonstrate basic JS concepts and syntax, the
data structure will most likely be an array of some type and the program will execute in a terminal.

I need to decide how to approach user interaction. If I made it execute automatically without user input that would be
kind of boring so I want there to be some level of interactivity, what that looks like I have yet to decide. A lot of
this is going to depend on what form this generator takes.

### POC

I have put together a basic POC for the project. I built a generic factory function with some prompt code to get user
input. All the code written is basic but works. It is all placeholder code for now and as such is subject to change.
It's just a couple of basic functions, but we are still in the planning stages and this is mostly to help me get some
basic structure in place.

To get myself started and out of any choice paralysis, I decided to make a fortune teller generator. Next is to refine
the code to fit the newly defined theme. The existing code will do the job but is generic and the arrays are gibberish.
The code functions and everything has been renamed to properly fit the theme. I am still working to dress it up and make
it look good. Right now it just prints a couple of statements and a single fortune. I am trying to come up with some
decorative elements to add to the output.

### Conclusion

In its current state the random generator meets the requirements laid out in the assignment. I may add to it later.
I have also decided that as this repository evolves and the filesystem grows, I will migrate project specific README to
a project folder and let this main README serve as an overview of the course and what the constraints were for each
project. I'm getting more comfortable with markdown so I may even link to the project READMEs from this one.
