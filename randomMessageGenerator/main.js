// the idea is to create some time of random message generator in JS
// I still need to figure out what context I want to use this in
// Maybe a chat bot or a fortune cookie generator or some kind of 
// quote generator or inspirational message generator, etc
// as we can see, the possibilities are vast
// The messages have to be comprised of three parts selected at random
// It's supposed to demonstrate JS basics, so the data structure should be arrays
// I may use some kind of factory function to generate messages
// I also need to consider interactivity. How will the user interact with the program
// Do I want them to use a prompt? Or enter input in a form?
// It will be a terminal program, because we are working with basic concepts
// This makes me want to lean toward a prompt
// It also could just run from initialization without user input, but that seems less fun
