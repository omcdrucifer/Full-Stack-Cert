# Full Stack Dev Course

Now that I've completed the CS course for Codecademy, I am excited to start a full stack development course. This course will include various portfolio projects throughout its duration.

Previously, I created separate repos for each project. However, I realized that this approach could lead to unnecessary clutter. As a best practice, I have now dedicated a single repository to host the entire course and all of its projects.

*Note: I haven't reached the first project yetâ€”this repository is currently being set up.*
