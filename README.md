# Full Stack Dev Course

Now that I've completed the CS course for Codecademy, I am excited to start a full stack development course. This course will include various portfolio projects throughout its duration.

Previously, I created separate repos for each project. However, I realized that this approach could lead to unnecessary clutter. As a best practice, I have now dedicated a single repository to host the entire course and all of its projects.

*Note: I haven't reached the first project yetâ€”this repository is currently being set up.*

## Portfolio Project 1: Random Message Generator

### Description

I have been given the assignment of creating some type of random message generator. The goal is to demonstrate basic
JavaScript skills, and basic programming concepts. I ultimately went with a fortune teller program to demonstrate a
random message generator. I have migrated the specific information about the project to a [README](https://github.com/omcdrucifer/Full-Stack-Cert/blob/main/randomMessageGenerator/README.md) in the project folder.

## Portfolio Project 2: Portfolio Website

### Description

The second project is to build a portfolio website with a list of projects and some contact information. The site is
suggested to be a maximum of two pages, with one for contact information. The site should be built using HTML, CSS, and
at least one interactive JS element. The instructions don't specify where to host it so I may use GitHub pages, though I
do have my own web hosting account that I could use. We shall see. The majority of details will be in the project [README](https://github.com/omcdrucifer/Full-Stack-Cert/blob/main/portfolioWebsite/README.md)
