# Full Stack Dev Course

Now that I've completed the CS course for Codecademy, I am excited to start a full stack development course. This course will include various portfolio projects throughout its duration.

Previously, I created separate repos for each project. However, I realized that this approach could lead to unnecessary clutter. As a best practice, I have now dedicated a single repository to host the entire course and all of its projects.

*Note: I haven't reached the first project yetâ€”this repository is currently being set up.*

## Portfolio Project 1: Random Message Generator

### Description

I have been given the assignment of creating some type of random message generator. The goal is to demonstrate basic
JavaScript skills, and basic programming concepts. I am still in the planning phase, so I have yet to decide what type
of program I want to create and how it will incorporate message generation. I will update as I go. For now I am going to
review the notes and examples I have taken from my coursework to date and decide. I might make a fortune cookie message
generator, or some kind of random quote generator. I need to nail that down still. 

I am going to go ahead and make the repo public since I am now at the first portfolio project.
