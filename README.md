-- FULL STACK DEV COURSE --
Now that I've completed the CS course for Codecademy, I am starting a full stack course.
Much like the previous course, there will be portfolio projects throughout the course.

Previously, I made repos for each project, but I realize that can create a lot of bloat
and the best practice would be to dedicate one repo to the entirety of the course and its projects.

I haven't reached the first project yet, I am just setting up the repo.
