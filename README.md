# Full Stack Dev Course

Now that I've completed the CS course for Codecademy, I am excited to start a full stack development course. This course will include various portfolio projects throughout its duration.

Previously, I created separate repos for each project. However, I realized that this approach could lead to unnecessary clutter. As a best practice, I have now dedicated a single repository to host the entire course and all of its projects.

*Note: I haven't reached the first project yetâ€”this repository is currently being set up.*

## Portfolio Project 1: Random Message Generator

### Description

I have been given the assignment of creating some type of random message generator. The goal is to demonstrate basic
JavaScript skills, and basic programming concepts. I am still in the planning phase, so I have yet to decide what type
of program I want to create and how it will incorporate message generation. I will update as I go. For now I am going to
review the notes and examples I have taken from my coursework to date and decide. I might make a fortune cookie message
generator, or some kind of random quote generator. I need to nail that down still. 

I am going to go ahead and make the repo public since I am now at the first portfolio project.

### Parameters

As previously mentioned, the basic concept is a random message generator. The concept is obviously very broad, so we
will put a pin in that for now. The messages are supposed to be fragmented in at least three parts, this seems to suggest
an almost Mad Libs type of approach. Being that the assignment is meant to demonstrate basic JS concepts and syntax, the
data structure will most likely be an array of some type and the program will execute in a terminal.

I need to decide how to approach user interaction. If I made it execute automatically without user input that would be
kind of boring so I want there to be some level of interactivity, what that looks like I have yet to decide. A lot of
this is going to depend on what form this generator takes.
